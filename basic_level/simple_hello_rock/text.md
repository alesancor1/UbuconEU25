# Create a Simple Hello Rock

In this step, you're provided with a partially completed `rockcraft.yaml` file. Your task is to **fill in the missing `base` and `parts` fields** so that this rock becomes a valid "Hello World" rock.

## üìù Instructions

Your `rockcraft.yaml` should describe a rock that:

- Uses the current Ubuntu LTS version as the base
- Has a `parts` section that doesn't require building (hint: consider a minimal plugin)
- Includes the `hello` package in that part

### Fields to Complete

Look for these two areas in the file and fill them out:

```yaml
base: # TODO fill this field

parts:
  hello: # TODO Fill this field
```

---

You can use `nano` or any other text editor to modify the rock file.
