# 🔧 Build a Minimal Hello Rock

Welcome to this hands-on lab! In this scenario, you’ll create and optimize a minimal container image (called a **rock**) using the [Rockcraft](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/) build tool. Rocks are OCI-compliant images with built-in system integration—perfect for building lightweight, secure container workloads.

## 🧭 What You'll Learn

You’ll go through **three exercises**, each building on the last, to transform a simple rock into an optimized, production-grade container:

### 1. ✅ **Create a Simple Hello Rock**
You’ll start with a partially completed `rockcraft.yaml` and fill in the required fields to create a basic working rock that runs the `hello` command.

### 2. 🛠️ **Make the Rock Baseless**
Next, you’ll optimize the rock by removing the base layer, making the container smaller and leaner using the `bare` base strategy.

### 3. ✂️ **Chisel the Rock**
Finally, you’ll replace full packages with **chisel slices**—a method of including only the essential files you need. This keeps the rock even more minimal and secure.
