You‚Äôve walked through every stage of building and securing a containerized service using **Rockcraft**‚Äîfrom static file packaging to HTTPS, rootless operation, and even building software from source.

Now, it‚Äôs your turn to apply everything you've learned... and push it even further.

## üß† What‚Äôs This Challenge About?

This is an **open-ended challenge** where you'll:

- Build a rock of **your own choice**
- Apply best practices you learned previously
- Explore new features by reading the docs
- Think beyond a single rock‚Äîmaybe add multiple versions, documentation, or CI workflows

This is your opportunity to take what you've practiced and create something **production-ready**, shareable, or just fun.

## üß™ About This Playground

This Killercoda environment is a **temporary playground** great for prototyping and experimentation.  
However, we encourage you to complete this challenge on **your own machine** to experience the full Rockcraft development workflow and iterate more easily.
