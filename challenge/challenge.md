## üéØ What You Need to Do

Create a rock using everything you've learned throughout this training‚Äîand beyond! This is an **open-ended** challenge with no "correct" answer.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Package a service or application you use frequently
- Include multiple versions of your rock (e.g., different upstream versions)
- Add documentation or CI/CD workflows as part of your rockcraft project
- Experiment with advanced Rockcraft features, like chisel slices or custom parts
- Optimize for security, performance, or usability

Some of the possibilities are:
