You've successfully gone from a basic static web server to a **rootless, HTTPS-enabled NGINX rock**, all built with **Rockcraft**! ðŸ’ª

This wasn't just a tour of commandsâ€”you've practiced real-world container building techniques focused on security, reproducibility, and modular design.

## âœ… Here's What You Accomplished

ðŸ”¹ **Step 1**: Created a rock with a simple `index.html` using the `dump` plugin  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 2**: Installed and configured NGINX to serve static content  
ðŸ”¹ **Optional**: Used **Chisel slices** and went **baseless** to reduce image size and attack surface  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 3**: Made your rock **rootless** using Rockcraftâ€™s `_daemon_` user and `run-user`  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 4**: Built **minica** from source and configured NGINX to serve via **HTTPS**
